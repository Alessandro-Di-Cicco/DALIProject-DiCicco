# DALI Project for AALS class
## Installation instructions
To run the project, simply extract it in the desired location, open the file `startmas.sh` and update the `SICSTUS_HOME` variable with the installation path of sicstus on the system.
I had some issues getting the project to work with tmux, so I employed an older `startmas.sh` script which opens individual Xterm windows for each agent in the MAS.
