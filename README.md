# DALI Project for AALS class
## Installation instructions
To run the project, simply clone the original DALI repository (https://github.com/AAAI-DISIM-UnivAQ/DALI) and place the contents of this repository inside the DALI folder (overwriting every modified file), open the file `startmas.sh` and update the `SICSTUS_HOME` variable with the installation path of sicstus on the system.
I had some issues getting the project to work with tmux, so I employed an older `startmas.sh` script which opens individual Xterm windows for each agent in the MAS.

## Credits
This project was developed using the DALI platform for the creation of MASs.
DALI is available at: https://github.com/AAAI-DISIM-UnivAQ/DALI
